# Ad Astra Prototype
 
This game was the result of a game dev week at my university.

It's a survival game where the player has to fight through waves of enemies in an arena. Different abilities can be chosen between rounds.

I did the UI programming on this project, including the menu, mealth/energy bars, skill slots and altars to choose new skills.
